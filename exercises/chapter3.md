1. Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of the following function that determines whether a given year is
   a leap year:
   ```javascript
   function isLeapYear(year) {
     return year % 100 === 0 ? year % 400 === 0 : year % 4 === 0;
   }
   ```
   O(1)
2. Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of the following function that sums up all the numbers from a
   given array:
   ```javascript
   function arraySum(array) {
     let sum = 0;
     for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
       sum += array[i];
     }
     return sum;
   }
   ```
   O(N)
3. The following function is based on the age-old analogy used to describe the power of compounding interest:
   Imagine you have a chessboard and put a single grain of rice on one square. On the second square, you put 2 grains of
   rice, since that is double the amount of rice on the previous square. On the third square, you put 4 grains. On the
   fourth square, you put 8 grains, and on the fifth square, you put 16 grains, and so on.
   The following function calculates which square youâ€™ll need to place a certain number of rice grains. For example, for
   16 grains, the function will return 5, since you will place the 16 grains on the fifth square.
   Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of this function, which is below:
   ```javascript
   function chessboardSpace(numberOfGrains) {
    let chessboardSpaces = 1;
    let placedGrains = 1;
    while (placedGrains < numberOfGrains) {
      placedGrains *= 2;
      chessboardSpaces += 1;
    }
    return chessboardSpaces;
   }
   ```
   O(logN)
4. The following function accepts an array of strings and returns a new array that only contains the strings that start
   with the character "a". Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of the function:
   ```javascript
   function selectAStrings(array) { 
    let newArray = [];
    for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      if (array[i].startsWith("a")) {
         newArray.push(array[i]);
      }
    }
    return newArray; 
   }
   ```
   O(N)
5. The following function calculates the median from an ordered array. Describe its time complexity in terms of Big O
   Notation:
   ```javascript
   function median(array) {
     const middle = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
     // If array has even amount of numbers:
     if (array.length % 2 === 0) {
       return (array[middle - 1] + array[middle]) / 2;
     } else { // If array has odd amount of numbers: return array[middle];
     }
   }
   ```
   O(1)
